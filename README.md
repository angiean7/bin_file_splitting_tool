# bin_file_splitting_tool

This project is used to split a 32-bit binary file into two 16-bit binary files with high and low bits respectively.
I created this tool because I sometimes need it myself and I hope it will help people who need it as much as I do.

## Quick start

### 1.  Download

First download this repository so you can use the tools

```
git clone https://github.com/angiean7/bin_file_splitting_tool.git
```

### 2. Usage

Open SplitBin.exe in the PofToBin_Tool folder.

Then select the file, click Convert, and you will find the split file in the same path as the source file.
